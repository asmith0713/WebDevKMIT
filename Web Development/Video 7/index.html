        Got wandering eyes
        That I seem to follow
        Can only stay still for some time
        I've never aligned
        With this city's pulse so
        That makes it easier to leave behind
        
        [Chorus: Juneau]
        I just wanna get to know
        Brighter lights in Tokyo
        Somehow hear it whisperin'
        I could be the one you're missing
        
        I just wanna get to know
        Brighter lights in Tokyo
        Somehow hear it whisperin'
        I could be the one you're missing
        
        [Drop]

        Wondering why
        I don't know the feeling
        Of walking through these streets like they're mine
        Trying to find
        A way to new beginnings
        Somewhere in a different life
        ]
        I just wanna get to know
        Brighter lights in Tokyo
        Somehow hear it whisperin'
        I could be the one you're missing
        
        I just wanna get to know
        Brighter lights in Tokyo
        Somehow hear it whisperin'
        
        I could be the one you're missing

        [Verse 1]
        Do you believe me when I say “I'm never like this”?
        Do you need me the way you say you do?
        Treading lightly through the water, through the light and darkness
        If I’m not careful, my love might consume you
        
        [Chorus]
        Pulling me back into my body
        I wanna take my time with you
        Your lips are gonna haunt me
        If what you say is true
        
        Pulling me back into my body
        I'm just a dead man walking
        I'm just a pawn
        But nothing hurts better than you
        
        [Pre-Drop]
        Pulling me back into my body
        I’m just a dead man walking
        I'm just a pawn
        But nothing hurts better than you
        
        [Drop]
        (Pulling me back)
        (I-I-I'm)
        (I'm just pulling me)
        
        [Verse 2]
        Are we doomed to the fate laid out before us?
        Can you lift a curse with a singlе kiss?
        Standing on the edge of thе, ever growing abyss
        Does it really have to end like this? (End like this?)
        
        [Chorus]
        Pulling me back into my body
        I wanna take my time with you
        Your lips are gonna haunt me
        If what you say is true
        
        Pulling me back into my body
        I'm just a dead man walking
        I'm just a pawn
        But nothing hurts better than you
        
        [Drop]
        (Pulling me)
        (I-I-I'm)
        (I'm just pulling me)
        (Pulling me)
        (I-I-I’m)
        (Pulling me)
        If what you say is true
        Pulling me back into my body
        I’m just a dead man walking
        I'm just a pawn
        But nothing hurts better than you
        [Outro]
        Nothing hurts better than you
        Yeah, nothing hurts better than you (you)

        I don’t know what you’ve been told
        But I’d be insane not to play my role
        Yeah, I know I can break or fold
        The stakes are low
        If I could say one thing
        
        Just know that I gotta hand that I can lend ya
        And it don’t matter when, know I’ll protect ya
        You can call on me
        I'm here whenever
        
        You know two greater than one but five is better
        Just know that I gotta hand that I can lend ya
        And it don’t matter when, know I’ll protect ya
        You can call on me
        I'm here whenever
        
        You know two greater than one but five is better
        Hey
        
        Oh, you think you tough, huh?
        I think that’s unlikely
        You can keep on lookin’ but
        Can’t find nobody like me
        
        El Dorado pushin’
        Boy, I'm fresher than a white tee
        You know I love you I need someone
        Who can guide me
        
        I can’t do no lil bag, (cash out)
        I need three mil
        Shots comin’ in
        Both directions just like a BeReal
        
        I been eating good
        Used to be lucky to get three meals
        First place, run it up
        Could care about what he feel
        
        'Cause I have you, you, you
        (Give you everything and anything you want)
        'Cause I have you, you, you
        (You’re my everything and anything beyond)
        
        Just know that I gotta hand that I can lend ya
        And it don’t matter when, know I’ll protect ya
        You can call on me
        I'm here whenever
        
        You know two greater than one but five is better
        Just know that I gotta hand that I can lend ya
        And it don’t matter when, know I’ll protect ya
        You can call on me
        I'm here whenever
        
        You know two greater than one
        But five is better
        Hey
        
        Two, one
        Two, one
